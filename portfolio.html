        WHAT I AM LEARNING
      </h2>
      <h3 class="text-sm text-center px-2 py-3">
        I am currently learning frontend programming, focusing on key
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and popular frameworks such as Tailwind
        CSS, Bootstrap, and ReactJS. My journey involves mastering the
        fundamentals of HTML and CSS to build well-structured, visually
        appealing web pages. To enhance my development speed and create
        responsive designs, I am diving into Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, both of
        which offer utility-first and component-based frameworks, respectively.
        Additionally, I am exploring ReactJS to build dynamic, interactive user
        interfaces, learning how to manage state, handle components, and
        structure applications effectively. Through hands-on practice and
        real-world projects, I'm continuously refining my skills to create
        modern, user-friendly web applications.

      <h3 class="text-sm text-center px-2 py-3 mb-5">
        In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me both
        entertained and intellectually engaged. Playing games is one of my
        favorite pastimes, allowing me to unwind while also sharpening my
        strategic thinking. Coding is another passion of mine, where I find joy
        in solving problems and building new projects. I also love reading,
        whether it's books, articles, or anything that expands my knowledge.
        Traveling is something I deeply appreciate, as it gives me the chance to
        explore new cultures and environments. I’m always excited about
        exploring new things, whether it’s learning a new skill, discovering new
        places, or experiencing something out of the ordinary. These activities
        help me stay curious and continuously grow as an individual.
